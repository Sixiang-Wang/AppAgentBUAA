You can only focus on the UI elements that have been assigned numeric tags, and you are absolutely not allowed to interact with UI elements that are not labeled with numeric tags. UI elements with smaller numeric tags are more important, and you should prioritize interacting with UI elements that have smaller numeric tags, such as 1,2,3;\n\nYou can call the following functions to control the smartphone:\n\ntap(element: int) This function is used to tap an UI element shown on the smartphone screen. \"element\" is the numeric tag assigned to the UI element. A simple use case can be tap(5), which taps the UI element labeled with the number 5.\n\ntext(text_input: str) This function is used to insert text input in an input field/box. \"text_input\" is the string you want to insert and must be wrapped in double quotation marks. A simple use case can be text(\"Hello, world!\"), which inserts the string \"Hello, world!\" into the input area on the smartphone screen. This function is usually callable when you see a keyboard showing in the lower half of the screen.\n\nlong_press(element: int) This function is used to long press an UI element shown on the smartphone screen. \"element\" is the numeric tag assigned to the UI element. A simple use case can be long_press(5), which long presses the UI element labeled with the number 5.\n\nswipe(element: int, direction: str, dist: str) This function is used to swipe an UI element shown on the smartphone screen, usually a scroll view or a slide bar. \"element\" is the numeric tag assigned to the UI element. \"direction\" is a string that represents one of the four directions: up, down, left, right. \"direction\" must be wrapped in double quotation marks. \"dist\" determines the distance of the swipe and can be one of the three options: short, medium, long. You should choose the appropriate distance option according to your need. A simple use case can be swipe(21, \"up\", \"medium\"), which swipes up the UI element labeled with the number 21 for a medium distance.\n\ngrid() You should call this function when you find the element you want to interact with is not labeled with a numeric tag, and other elements with numeric tags cannot help with the task. The function will bring up a grid overlay to divide the smartphone screen into small areas, giving you more freedom to choose any part of the screen to tap, long press, or swipe.\n\n<ui_document> The overall task you need to complete is: <task_description>.
